title: 10 weird things cats do (Explained)
description: Cats are funny, confusing, and sometimes downright strange. One minute they’re cuddling, and the next they’re knocking things off a table for no obvious reason. While these behaviors may seem weird to us, there’s usually a reason behind them. Here are ten common “weird” things cats do—and what they actually mean.

## 1. Knocking Things Off Tables

Cats knock objects off tables because they are curious and playful. This behavior also helps them test cause and effect. In some cases, cats may do this to get attention from their owner.

## 2. Sitting in Boxes (No Matter the Size)

Cats love boxes because they provide a sense of safety and comfort. A box gives a cat a place to hide while still observing their surroundings. Even small boxes can make cats feel secure.

## 3. Staring at Nothing

It may look like your cat is staring at a wall, but they are likely reacting to sounds or movements that humans can’t detect. Cats have extremely sensitive hearing and vision.

## 4. Kneading with Their Paws

Kneading is a behavior cats learn as kittens. It is associated with comfort and relaxation. When adult cats knead, it usually means they feel safe and content.

## 5. Running Around Suddenly (Zoomies)

Those sudden bursts of energy are often called “the zoomies.” Cats may do this to release pent-up energy, especially if they haven’t had enough playtime during the day.

## 6. Sleeping in Strange Positions

Cats can sleep in odd positions because they feel safe in their environment. When a cat sleeps on their back or in a twisted position, it’s often a sign of trust and relaxation.

## 7. Bringing You “Gifts”

Some cats bring their owners toys—or even bugs—as gifts. This behavior comes from their natural hunting instincts and can be a sign that your cat sees you as part of their family.

## 8. Headbutting You

Headbutting, also known as bunting, is a way cats show affection. Cats have scent glands on their heads, and headbutting helps mark you as someone they trust.

## 9. Chattering at Birds

When cats chatter at birds or squirrels, it’s believed to be a mix of excitement and frustration. This behavior shows how strong a cat’s hunting instincts are.

## Following You Everywhere (Cutest thing in my opinion!)

If your cat follows you from room to room, it could mean they enjoy your company or are simply curious about what you’re doing. Some cats are naturally more social than others.

## Final thoughts

While cats may seem strange at times, their behaviors usually have simple explanations. Understanding why cats act the way they do can help strengthen your bond with them.

At The Curious Cat, even the weirdest habits have a reason.
