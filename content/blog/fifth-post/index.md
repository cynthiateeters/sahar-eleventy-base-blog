## Myth 1: Cats Always Land on Their Feet

While cats are incredibly agile, they don’t always land perfectly. Their “righting reflex” helps them twist in midair, but injuries can still happen if they fall from a height. It’s important to keep your cat safe indoors or provide secure outdoor spaces.

## Myth 2: Cats Are Solitary and Don’t Like Company

Many cats love companionship, both from humans and other pets. While cats may value independence, they also form strong bonds and enjoy social interaction. Some cats even prefer being in pairs or small groups.

## Myth 3: Cats Only Purr When They’re Happy

Cats purr for a variety of reasons: happiness, stress relief, or even healing. Don’t assume a purring cat is always content—pay attention to their body language and overall behavior.

## Myth 4: Cats Are Low-Maintenance Pets

Cats can be independent, but they still need care, attention, and stimulation. Regular play, grooming, feeding, and health check-ups are essential for a happy, healthy cat.

## Myth 5: You Can’t Teach an Old Cat New Tricks

Cats of any age can learn new behaviors! Using positive reinforcement, treats, and patience, even older cats can learn tricks, litter box training, or new routines.

## Myth 6: Cats Hate Water

While many cats don’t enjoy being submerged, not all cats dislike water. Some breeds, like Maine Coons or Turkish Vans, enjoy playing with water. It’s best to introduce water gradually and in a safe, controlled way.

## Final Thoughts

Cats are full of surprises, and understanding the truth about them helps you take better care of your furry friend. By debunking these myths, you can strengthen your bond, avoid misconceptions, and enjoy your cat for who they really are.

At The Curious Cat, curiosity leads to understanding and understanding leads to a happier cat.
