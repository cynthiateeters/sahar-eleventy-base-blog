## Cats purr when they're happy

The most common reason cats purr is because they feel relaxed and content. Many cats purr when they are being petted, cuddling with their owner, or resting in a comfortable spot. In these moments, purring is a way for cats to express comfort and trust.

If your cat is lying down, has relaxed body language, and is purring softly, it’s usually a sign that they are feeling safe and happy.

## Cats Also Purr to Comfort Themselves

Surprisingly, cats don’t only purr when they’re happy. Some cats purr when they are stressed, scared, or even in pain. This is because purring can help calm them down.

Experts believe that purring may help cats relax by releasing tension in their bodies. In stressful situations, purring can act as a form of self-soothing, similar to how humans might take deep breaths when they feel anxious.

## Purring Can Help with Healing

Another interesting reason cats purr is for healing. Studies suggest that the vibrations produced by purring may help promote healing in a cat’s body. These vibrations can support bone strength and muscle repair.

This could explain why cats sometimes purr when they are injured or recovering. Purring may help them feel better both physically and emotionally.

## Final thoughts

Purring is one of the many ways cats communicate with us. While it often means they’re happy, it can also be a sign of stress or self-healing. Understanding why cats purr helps strengthen the bond between cats and their owners.
